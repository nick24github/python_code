#--------------------------List vs Tuple----------------------
# List & Tuple both are collection of different data type values

# List
# 1)List is a comma saperated values in square brakets and square braket is mandatory.
Data = ['Jay', 23, 30000]
# 2)List is mutable 
# 3)Memory Consumption:
# 3.1)List is slow in execution than tuple.
# 3.2)List is less efficient in memory utilization than tuple.
# 4)Comprehension concept
# 4.1)Comprehension concept is applicable only for list and not for tuple.
# 5)Packing & Unpacking
# 5.1)List supports packing but not supports unpacking.


# Tuple
# 1)Tuple is a comma saperated values in parenthesis and parenthesis is optional
Data = ('jay', 23, 30000)
# 2)Tuple is Immutable
# 3)Tuple object takes less memory than list object for same data
# 4)Comprehension concept is not applicable for tuple.
# 5)Tuple supports  both packing & unpacking.
