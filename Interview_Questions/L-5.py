#Q.1) What is python? and define Python

# Python is a programming language created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.
# It is a simple , general purpose, dynamically-typed , high-level, object-oriented 
# programming language. It is an interpreted language which supports multiple paradigms.
# i.e. functional approach, procedural approach, OOP approach, modular approach for 
# writing programs.

# Then, Elaborate Keywords:-
# 1)Python can be use in many domains such as ML,AI,scripting,web dev, data science, data 
# analytics etc and that's why python is called general purpose language.
# 2)Python Interpretes data types at runtime and hence called as dynamically typed language.
# 3)Python supports OOP style and we can create classes and objects in python.Python is
#   strongly object-oriented language as everything in python is considered as an object.
# 4)Python is open-source and free as we can download python from its official website
# without paying any penny. Python is also platform independent. Because of all these features,
# python is most versatile and popular language of the 21st century.


#Q.2) Python Compiled or Interpreted 

# How Python works?
# 1)Write a sorce code. and save by .py extension
# 2)Compile code using python compiler.
# 3)Compiler converts into byte code.
# 4)Computer doesn't understand bytecode 
# 5)So, PVM converts bytecode into machine code using Interpreter.

#Q.3) Why we need both ?
# 1) If we use only compiler, You will have speed but not portability.
# 2) If we use only Interpreter, You will have portability but not speed .
# 3) So, using both is compromise between speed and portability.

#Q.4) Python Compiler/flavors :
# 1) C Python
# 2) JPython / Jython
# 3) Ruby Python 
# 4) Iron Python
# 5) Stackless Python 
# 6) Python XY

#Q.5) Python Compiled or Interpreted ?
# 1) Python is compiled-interpreted language.
# 2) Python is neither true compiled nor pure interpreted.
# 3) But,python is always referred as interpreted language.

#Q.6) Python Versions:
# First Version:-0.9.0(1991)
# Two major versions:-
# Python 2.0  (oct 2000)
# Python 3.0  (dec 2008)

#Q.7) Python 2.0 is legacy while python 3.0 is present and future.
# In Python 3:
# No Backward Compatibility.
# Python2 and Python3 are quite different.
# You can't port python3 code into python2 code. 

#Q.8) Diff in Python2 Or Python3
# 1) Division Operator:
# Python2:- return integer
# Python3:- return float
# 2)Printing:
# Python2:- print is statement print"Hello" 
# Python3:- print is function print("hello")
# 3)Input:- 
# Python2:- both input() and raw_input()
# Python3:- only input() function
# 4)Iteration:
# Python2:- range() and xrange() functions.
# Python3:- only range() function.
# 5)way of storing characters:-
# Python2:-stores in ASCII
# Python3:-stores in unicode value

# Q.9)What is diff b/w 'is' operator and '==' operator in python ?
# is:
# this is a identity operator.
# checks memory reference/memory address of two objects.
# returns True:-if two objects have same identity number.
# ==:
# this is a comparision operator.
# checks actual/content and values of two objects.
# returns True:- if two content have same content.
